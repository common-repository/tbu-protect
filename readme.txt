== Description ==
TBU Protect is a Wordpress Plugin developed by THEMES BY US. It's main goal is
to prevent anyone from stealing your content, media, and effort. This plugin
succeeds where others fail. It's multi-level feature-pack protection schemes
will work for simple bloggers to large complicated site protections. Strongbox
gives you complete control blocking 99.9% of attempts to steal your hard work.
As you will read below this plugin is not for the faint hearted. Some features
do come with drawbacks. Strongbox is a shell for wordpress. It prevents people
from stealing by creating layered obsfucation and encryption. It's such a
thick layer using ajax as communication it makes anyone without javascript
parser broken at the start. It works by using common technologies in various
languages including Wordpress to create break points in the execution at which
they are encrypted. This is a reversible encryption so in their someone could
reverse engineer this script (likely), build a javascript parsing robot (not
likely), then custom engineer a scrapper (not likely) all to just get to a
point where they could automate a scrapping. Combine that with a feature
packed javascipt annoyance package and your basic low-intelligent screening
filters you will easily ward-off the majority of would be stealers, thieves,
hackers, scrapers, bots, search engines, but not your value customers.

2. Unzip `tbu_protect.zip`
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

That's it.  It's intention was to be easy at this stage, just demostrating how
lockdown this system will be.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why the encryption everywhere? =

It is mainly to act as trespass signs to anyone looking to take information
quickly and without warrant.  As all know there is nothing that will stop
persistant individuals.  However this particular plugin stops them at all
levels and encrypts them with genetic alorithms that regenrate everytime the
use them.   Underneath is them powered by a cloud tagging file system that
moves names around to make it near impossible to capture and scrap in any
tradional manner.

= How do I do X/Y? =
